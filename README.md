1.) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Making rigorous tests, and adherence to coding standards is how I make sure my code is function and secure for each of my projects.

2.) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Through requirement reviews and interviews are the ways I understand the needs of my users and make sure that they are met in my program. Otherwise, my program is not helpful to anyone.

3.) How do I approach designing software?

Having clearly defined goals before the start of each project is a good start to designing software. Then having a user centered design is one of the best software approaches to be sure the requirements are met properly.
